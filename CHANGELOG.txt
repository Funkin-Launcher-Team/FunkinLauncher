This is one of the biggest updates of the app because there's 1-click mod downloading (the purpose of this... lol).

Please keep in mind that all of the mods you've ever installed are logged and kept ONLY on your machine. I plan to make an embedded mod updater in v.1.5, and I'd like to already have a local database to base it on so I don't have to write migration code or whatever.
