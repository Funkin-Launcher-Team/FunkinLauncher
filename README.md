# How to run

You'll need Node.js installed.

1) Use ``npm i`` to install all dependencies
2) Also install Electron with ``npm install electron --save-dev``
3) Use ``curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toperri/camerawork/main/camerawork.js -o static/js/camerawork.js`` to download the latest version of camerawork (NOTICE: camerawork is hosted under another license!)

4) You can now use ``npm test`` to run the app.

# Building

Feel free to use electron-forge or electron-builder to build Funkin Launcher. I instead downloaded Electron prebuilts from their GitHub and edited the .exe's icon.
