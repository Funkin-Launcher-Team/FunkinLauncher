# FunkinLauncher

An AIO tool for managing FNF.

# How to run

1) Use ``npm i`` to install all dependencies
2) Also install Electron with ``npm install electron --save-dev``
3) The ``bgv.mp4`` file (the animated background) is too heavy for GitHub. Download it by running: ``curl https://ffm-backend.web.app/source-code/bgv.mp4 -o static/bgv.mp4`` (while in the root directory)
4) You can now use ``npm test`` to run the app.

# Building

Feel free to use electron-forge or electron-builder to build Funkin Launcher. I instead downloaded Electron prebuilts from their GitHub and edited the .exe's icon.
